# vodex : Volumetric Data and Experiment manager
Vodex is a Python library for dealing with volumetric movies , written as a sequence of slices and split across multiple tif files.
It will keep track of full volumes / particular z-slices, making it easy to do requests like " give me a z slice # 23 from the whole movie , or give me volumes # 6, 85 and 54, regardless of wether these volumes are split between multiple tif files. It can also link particular experimental conditions to certain volumes/slices, making it easier to request something like " give me all full volumes when I was shining the green light " or " give me all slices # 16 after we have administered the drug ".
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install vodex.

pip install vodex
```
